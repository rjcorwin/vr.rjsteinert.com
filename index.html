<ol> 
  <li> Acquire an Android phone (tablets are too big).</li>
  <li> In Play store, update Chrome and install Google VR Services.</li>
  <li> Assemble your Google Cardboard. Open the top flap and you will find direction inside. </li>
  <li> Before inserting phone into Google Cardboard, go to <a href="tangerine.html">this link</a> and tap "enter VR" in the bottom right. </li>
  <li> Now insert phone into the google cardboard and have fun! Note, if it hurts your eyes the phone may not be aligned correctly in the case, wiggle left and rigth to find the correct position. </li>
